# PPSN2020
This repository contains the code for the implementation of the experiments in the following paper.

[Improving Imbalanced Classification by Anomaly Detection](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58112-1_35)


The provided .py file is for the convenience of reproducing the main results of my PPSN paper.

## Datasets

You can find the benchamrk datasets we use in this paper in folder `data`. For more dataset, you can find it in the [KEEL repository](https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/imbalanced.php).

## Experiment Setup

The codes for 2D chess datset and imbalanced benchmark datasets cna be found in `2D chess` and `Imbalanced Benchmark`. The experimental results for various scenarios are available in `results`.
